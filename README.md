Improves RB change formatting

ReviewBoard does not provide good support when viewing indentation changes. Often times adding an if statement or HTML tag around a code block would mess up the diff view, creating a bunch of “Moved from …” sections, making it extremely difficult to see what the actual changes are.

This extension prettifies the diffs by properly ignoring the whitespace changes and provides a more focus view into the file diffs.
